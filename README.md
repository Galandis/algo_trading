# algo_trading
This repository contains codes used for algorithmic trading via Oanda API.

It is a part of a masters degree thesis.
There is a code which only works having brokerage account in Oanda as connection is necessary.

The goal is to create three separate algorithms for automated trading.
1st will be based on price action.
2nd will be based on indicators.
3rd will be based on machine learning.

Once rules are created then as base for choosing a right model will be iterative backtesting run across already existing data.
After that there will be connection established with demo account in Oanda and strategies will be tested in live market.

This is not a working and complete product.
